      <h1>Charged Particles</h1>
     <p>The magnitude of an electric field at a point due to a single particle can be calculated using the formula E = kq/r<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p>q is the charge of the particle, r is the distance from the particle, and k is the proportionality constant, also known as the Coulomb constant, which is approximately 9 x 10<sup>9</sup> N m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup></p>
      <p>When the particle has a positive charge, this field points directly away from the particle, and vice versa for a negatively charged particle</p>
      <p>When there is multiple particles, taking the x, y, and z components by using trigonometry tells us the direction and magnitude of the electric field at any point</p>
