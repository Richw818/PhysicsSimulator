      <h1>Charged Particles</h1>
     <p>The magnitude of an electric field due to a particle can be calculated using the formula E = kq/r<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p>When the particle has a positive charge, this field points directly away from the particle, and vice versa for a negatively charged particle</p>
      <p>When there is multiple particles, taking the x, y, and z components by using trigonometry tells us the direction and magnitude of the electric field at any point</p>
